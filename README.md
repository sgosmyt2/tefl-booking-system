# TEFL Booking System

This project is a personal learning portfolio project exploring backend dev with Flask through designing a lesson booking system for TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) lessons. The aim of this system is to manage availability and lesson bookings so that it is robust regardless of time zones and scheduling conflicts, reflecting the real world constraints when teaching students across regions.

## Methods

- Language: Python
- Framework: Flask
- Data Storage (Future): SQLite
- Environment: Conda, VSCode

## Current Functionality

- Define available time slots manually
- View available slots through a REST API
- Book lessons through a POST request
- Prevent double booking and overlapping time slots
- Persistent storage with SQLite, adding and cancelling bookings

## Planned extensions

- Time zone handling 
- Cancellation of bookings
- Comparative scheduling views
- Payment system
